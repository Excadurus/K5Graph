The Aim of this Project is to find the Minimal Spanning Tree using Prime Algorithm in a way that by adding one extra edge, you get a Minimal Graph with a cycle
In case you are just interested in the Prime MST algorithm you can just refer to MSTPrime Class and ignore the recursive method's closing condition
